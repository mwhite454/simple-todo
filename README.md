# Simple-ToDo
A simple and ephemeral todo app - this application currently has no permanent storage.

## Current Functions
- Add new tasks to the to do list.
- Rapid addition by hitting enter. Just keep typing.
- Hashtag filtering. Each task can have multiple hashtags/topics assigned.
- List items can be moved to the 'done' list by clicking done, and removed entirely by clicking delete.

## Future State
- Firebase with Google/Facebook Auth
- Local Storage options for those not interested in sharing credentials
- Color coding based on age in queue
- Auto delete of oldest/expired items
- Priority flagging
- Interpreter to review task for time based content and flag for priority on a timer
